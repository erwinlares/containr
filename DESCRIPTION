Package: containr
Title: Containerize Your 'R' Project
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: 
    person("Erwin", "Lares", email = "erwin.lares@wisc.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Automates the process of containerizing 'R' projects. The core
    function of 'containr' is 'generate_dockerfile()', which analyzes an 'R'
    project's environment and dependencies via an 'renv' lockfile and generates
    a ready-to-use 'Dockerfile' that encapsulates the computational setup. The
    package helps researchers build portable and consistent workflows so that
    analyses can be reliably shared, archived, and rerun across systems. See
